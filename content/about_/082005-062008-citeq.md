I did my edication at [Stadt Münster - citeq](http://www.citeq.de/) for *IT Specialist for Software Development*. Creating .NET based Client/Server applications and Oracle Database Development was my key business there.

Additionaly i cared about multiple [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) instances, which ic could establish as the central documentation platform there. Writing some special extensions was my job, too.
